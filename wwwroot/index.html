                    <p>
                        I started out in the 90ties with Bryce 3d and poser which i got free older version of from a
                        computer magazine which was a thing back then.<br />
                        Later i taught my self 3d studio max though badly... <br />
                        Then i studied 3d and was actually taugh maya which frankly i cant excuse paying for so tha
                        skillset
                        has mostly degraded by now...<br />
                        But i did master sketchup which i use the 2017 make version of to this day using Wine in linux.
                        (i
                        recently finally got the thing to update visually consistently yay!)<br />
                        <br />
                        I use it for all my 3d priting and laser cutting project but the drawback here is its not good
                        for
                        rounded elements so my 3d work has gone in a very engenerring directed direction where i mostly
                        build functional pieces.<br />
                        <br />
                        Today i will happily employ both techniques in tandem.

                    <p>
                        I've studied art somewhat and it something i do from time to time but maybe not as extensivly as
                        in
                        the past.<br />
                        usually its judy doodles tanks, giant, robots scantily clad catgirl etc... <br />
                        <br />
                        But i also draw practical things like design i later 3d print or laser cut or otherwise build..
                        wireframes for layout etc etc..<br />
                        <br />
                        Art has always been an interest and i have used an array of diffrent techniques generally but
                        mostly
                        i draw...<br />
                        mostly in a anime style. <br />
                        I am not very efficent about it though and will spend way to much time on a single work if i go
                        all
                        the way and decide to digitally outline color and shade it. <br />
                        Also i am horribly inconsistent in style partly from changing my technique around and choice of
                        art
                        supplies used. <br />
                        one day i may be using pro markrs and fiber pens... then next maybe i am experimenting with some
                        odd
                        combination of tipex and fiber pens or i am using in pens
                        or just a mechanical pencel and thin mechanicaly feeding eraser and then scanning and outlining
                        digitally.. <br /> or turning it into a SVG even. <br />
                        <br />
                        As of late i have mostly been working directly in boxy3d doing svg designs.<br />
                        <br />
                        I've done some logo design but my nepew is probably still a bit better at that sort of thing.

                        I do like playing any kind of keyed instrument generally speaking... though i can only really
                        pick
                        out a melody so not really skilled its more something i aspired to..

                        I also like tinkering in FL studio...

                        I 3d print a lot of things... well when my 3d printers are not broken or jammed and i am to shit
                        lazy to fix them.<br />
                        before i've done things like tripods and repairs to tools and even tried making a lathe... not
                        practical by my methods though someone did try it but with concreet as a filler which looks
                        interesting..
                        i've done something similar when i plaster filled a dumbel 3d printed...<br /><br />

                        other then that i've done containers and paint bottle trays etc... all useful
                        stuff..<br /><br />

                        Hell i even made weaving supplies for my mom.

                            A set of terminal tools for converting a ebook in epub format into a set of mp3s though i
                            also
                            have plans for a more structured capable format and player...<br /><br />

                            (not currently public... i really need to clean this one up a bit had handle variations in
                            epub
                            formating currently i am just kinda manually altering the source at need to compensate which
                            works for me but is not a generally good solution...)

                        </header>
                        <p>comicbook reader uses format like cbr and cbz (rar and zip based) inside its just numbered
                            immages...
                            <br /> <br />
                            My idea is to stick scripted html and a text transcript of the speech bubbles and
                            have TTS.

                            (I've sort of started and given up on this one a few times... initially because of issue
                            debugging the embeded browser component i was using.. i know how too do that now so i expect
                            more progress next time i get around to this... but to make it viable i need some kind of
                            editor
                            for it too...)

                    <p>
                        I rather enjoy writing poetry and i do from time to time tinker with writing stories... though i
                        get Fairlyfar in world building i rarely get very far on actually writing anything other then an
                        general story outline.<br />

                        <br />
                        now as for poetry there i have some achivments...<br />
                        <br />

                        I have for instance a rather long super villain poem that is meant to follow a narrative
                        involving a love triangle and time travel....<br />.<br />
                        <br />
                        I also wrote a poem that doubles a skyrim build guide and exploit guide for a stealth archer
                        build / unstopable necromancer.
