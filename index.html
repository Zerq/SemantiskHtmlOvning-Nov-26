                    I 3d print a lot of things... well when my 3d printers are not broken or jammed and i am to shit
                    lazy to fix them.<br />
                    before i've done things like tripods and repairs to tools and even tried making a lathe... not
                    practical by my methods though someone did try it but with concreet as a filler which looks
                    interesting..
                    i've done something similar when i plaster filled a dumbel 3d printed...<br /><br />

                    other then that i've done containers and paint bottle trays etc... all useful stuff..<br /><br />

                    Hell i even made weaving supplies for my mom.

                        This is my own spa framework using only the build in esm module

                        post transpilation modification steps to enable TSX template support...</p>

                    <p>It also has a custom written router and currently uses webcomponents
                        though i am looking at replacing those.</p>

                    <p>I also need to write a better IOC container halfway thinking of adding a post transpilation
                        processing step to grab the interface names and relationships into a metadata file or
                        something...
                        i might be doing a metadata layer thingy for exporting dotnet class info into javascript
