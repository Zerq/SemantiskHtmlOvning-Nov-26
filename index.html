                    <p>
                        This is my own spa framework using only the build in esm module
                        loader and typescript with mainly build side npm refernces only and some
                        post transpilation modification steps to enable TSX template support...</p>
    
                    <p>It also has a custom written router and currently uses webcomponents
                        though i am looking at replacing those.</p>
    
                    <p>I also need to write a better IOC container halfway thinking of adding a post transpilation
                        processing step to grab the interface names and relationships into a metadata file or something...
                        i might be doing a metadata layer thingy for exporting dotnet class info into javascript anyway...
                    </p>
                    <p>That and i am half way wondering if i coudl transfer property getter setter logic too using
                        webassembly...
                        <br />
                        But that is kind of a crazy idea.
