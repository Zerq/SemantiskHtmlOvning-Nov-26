For some reason i could not run it through wave on my linux system...


when i launch my own spa engine test page it does launch a cromeium instance 
capable of actually running the wave plugin.. but in all other cases it wont work for me on linux...
gonna look into solving that but not sure why its behaving like that...

Normally i test on ungoogled chrome but that one just wont take that plugin at all.. and i did get regular chrome for this but still having problems with it...

might be some flatpack issue... might be able ot solve it with flatseal but might take tinkering... or i might just have to figure out how to easily move stuff to my secondary window computer in my bedroom for testing.
i can remote to it.... 


I also cheated a bit and got in on the css a bit early but the images where cramping my style and if i am gonna cheat i may as well lay down some basic layout...



generated a basic .net template and put the static html files and content under wwwroot since my linux installation is doing something odd with chrome stops wave asscessability evaluaton tool from working properly....
this is my temporary fix until i can investigte further.
